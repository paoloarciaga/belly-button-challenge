This project explores microbial data using the D3.js library to interpret and visualize information from a comprehensive JSON dataset. It aims to reveal top Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in individuals, utilizing dynamic visualizations like horizontal bar charts and bubble charts. The user-friendly interface features dropdown menus and responsive charts for seamless navigation, offering insights into microbial communities within each sample. Demographic metadata is also displayed, enhancing dataset context. Hosted on GitHub Pages for accessibility, the project emphasizes the potential of web-based data visualization tools in understanding microbiological ecosystems through analytics.
